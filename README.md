# PolyTraverse
### Goal
To build a program which reads in a wavefront (.obj) file, parses it into some graph-like structure, and applies Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to it in order to find the shortest path (based on Euclidean distance) between any two faces. Finally, this path of faces is then outputted as a wavefront file.
